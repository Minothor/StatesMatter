StatesMatter
============
StatesMatter will be a dictionary linking API for Forge, designed to provide a unified manner of converting between solids, liquids and gasses.
Solids may be registered with the ore dictionary.
liquids and gasses must be registered in the fluids API and dictionary.
This API will add sample behaviour for gases based around +/- density rules compared to (air=0) that may be implemented or overridden freely.

This is currently not being actively worked on by Minothor until MonkeyWrench is in a stable and usable form.

The purpose of this repository until then is to keep the planning on this API open and publically available.
This should allow for requirements, suggestions and alterations to be added and made to the direction that this project will take.
Planning can be followed and joined in on the Wiki.
