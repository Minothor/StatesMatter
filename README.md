StatesMatter
============
StatesMatter aims to be a dictionary linking API for Forge, designed to provide a unified manner of converting between solids, liquids and gasses.
Solids may be registered with the ore dictionary; liquids and gasses must be registered in the fluids API.
Both of sides of the matter link must be registered before the link can be created. The matter handler will not register ores or entities for you.
